NFT collection landing page built with TypeScript/React/Next.js/TailwindCSS to display AI generated NFT collections

## Project Description

This is a professional enterprise landing page to display NFT collections with a clean and modern design. NFT images were created using StarryAI's AI generation. Users are able to view and filter by different collections.

#### Areas of Focus 
- Clean, modern design using Tailwind CSS
- Filtering state of NFT collections with grid display
- Managing and Lifting State with useState() hook to dynamically change UI
- Optimizing image quality using Next.js Image component
- Libraries for animations and typewriter effects
- Custom reusable card component for NFT display in different states

#### Challenges
Greatest challenge in this project was implementing a pixel perfect design from modern inspiration to provide a modern, professional feel of a marketing landing page for an NFT collection. Chose TailwindCSS to successfully achieve using utility classes.

## Flow of Website (Sections)

1. Main landing page with offset and overlapping NFT cards
2. Top trending NFTs section
3. Section to educate user on NFTs and the inspiration for the collections
4. Filtered grid of different collections
5. Animated display of creators
6. Footer with call to action and additional resources

## Background

#### Why I Built This
I built this website after becoming inspired by many other NFT website designs and their modern approach. I wanted to test my ability in developing from a modern design using TailwindCSS and other modern tools. My other inspiration was after using the StarryAI platform for fun to create AI generated images. My roomates and I were testing the AI abilities by prompting with a sports themed with random context to see what it would come up with. I used an Impressionist theme that resulted in some interesting creations that are displayed as collections in this website.

#### Potential Next Steps
- Functionality to edit each 'Today' workout live when user is working out to reflect any changes in the workout for that day
- Styling improvements to have everything within the viewport and not as much scrolling
